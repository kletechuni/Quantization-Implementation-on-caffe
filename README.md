# Quantization-Implementation-on-caffe

Project Status:

Caffe installation on Ubuntu 18.04 is completed.
Sample Image classification application is developed to understand the Caffe Framework and its working.
Working on identifying suitable quantization mechanism on different layers.
Survey is being carried out to understand implementation of Caffe layers with quantized data types.
Implementation layers:
- Convolution
- Depthwise Convolution
- Deconvolution
- Eltwise Addition
- Avg Pooling
- Max Pooling
- ReLU
